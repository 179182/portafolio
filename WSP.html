                            Game modes released in 2017 include Fortnite: Battle Royale, a free-to-play game where up to one hundred players fight on an island, the last one left alive is the winner, and as the game progresses the map gets smaller due to the storm, and Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative and paid game for up to four players that consists of fighting against zombie-like creatures, using items, improvements and fortifications.
                            
                            There is also the Creative Mode where players can create their own islands, and play those of other players.
                            
                            Both game modes were released in 2017 (except for Creative, which was in 2018) as Early Access titles. Save the World is available only for Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, while Battle Royale has also been released for Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android devices, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft is the best-selling video game in history, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2021, and has been ported to several platforms.

                            In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with virtually infinite terrain and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health) and a creative mode (in which players have unlimited resources and access to flight)</p>
